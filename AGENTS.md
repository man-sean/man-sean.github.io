# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Jekyll site configuration lives in `_config.yml`; global styles are in `style.scss` and `_sass/`.
- Page layouts are in `_layouts/` (`default.html`, `post.html`).
- Blog/content entries are in `_posts/` using the `YYYY-MM-DD-title.markdown` naming pattern. Older content is archived in `_old_posts/`.
- Media assets live in `images/` and downloadable artifacts (papers, slides) in `pdfs/`.
- Thumbnail images are stored in `tn/` and are generated by `_make_thumbnails.sh`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `jekyll serve` runs the site locally with live reload (default at `http://127.0.0.1:4000`).
- `jekyll build` generates the static site into `_site/` for deployment.
- `_make_thumbnails.sh` creates thumbnails into `tn/` from `images/` so layouts can reference smaller versions.
- `_make_favicon.sh` rebuilds the favicon from the source image.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Follow existing formatting in each file type (YAML in `_config.yml`, Markdown in `_posts/`, SCSS in `style.scss` and `_sass/`).
- Keep front matter at the top of posts (e.g., `layout`, `title`, `date`) and match the existing key naming style.
- Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames for new posts and assets (e.g., `2026-02-01-new-project.markdown`, `images/new-project.png`).

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated test suite is configured. Validate changes by running `jekyll serve` and checking key pages and posts in the browser.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Git history only contains an “Initial commit,” so no formal convention exists yet. Use concise, imperative summaries (e.g., “Add new publication entry”).
- For PRs, include: a short description, the pages you changed, and screenshots if you modified layouts or styling.

## Content & Asset Notes
- This repository is a forked Jekyll template adapted for a personal academic site. Respect copyright for materials under `images/`, `pdfs/`, and `_posts/`.
